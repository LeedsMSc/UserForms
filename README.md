Excel VBA UserForms:

1) This project includes custom Excel UserForms designed to aid with data input and extraction during a scoping review.
The UserForms are equipped with various controlslike text boxes and buttons for efficient data handling.

2) To use the UserForms, macros must be enabled in Excel. This is necessary because UserForms operate with VBA,
a programming language for Excel automation. Note: although enabling macros is necessary to use these UserForms,
be aware that macros can potentially be used to run malicious code.

3) To view or edit the VBA code: open the Excel workbook; go to the 'Developer' tab, click on the 'Visual Basic' icon to open the VBA editor.

4) The UserForms require access to the 'Background.jpg', 'ButtonOne.jpg', and 'ButtonTwo.jpg'. These files
must be kept in the same folder as the 'UserForm (Data Extraction)', 'UserForm (Screening - Abstract)', and
'UserForm (Screening - FullArticle)' files.

5) Storing these files on dynamic cloud storage solutions like OneDrive may result in errors due to path changes.
It's recommended to keep these files in a static location on your local drive.

6) This project incorporates VBA code originally authored by 'WiseOwlTutorials' and 'VBA A2Z'.The tutorials from these sources
have been instrumental in the development of this project. Additionally, this README file was enhanced with contributions from an AI assistant,
providing clarity and guidance for users less familiar with Excel VBA UserForms.
